# Shepherd

![In action!](/art/preview.gif)

Shepherd is a super simple Discord bot that utilizes the new [Time Out feature](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/4413305239191) to control message spam.

Shepherd is still a work-in-progress but is very much functional! More features are being planned and you can suggest more by [creating an issue.](https://github.com/depthbomb/Shepherd/issues/new)
